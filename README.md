# SMS-Spam-Detection-Using-LSTM-Neural-Networks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. The model uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning to achieve accurate classifications.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for model training.
- **Text Embedding:** Using one-hot encoding and padding to prepare text sequences.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implementing an LSTM-based neural network for classification.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
